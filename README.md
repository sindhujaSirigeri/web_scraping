## Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project
### Background
Welcome to the Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project! This project empowers you to undertake a comprehensive journey of web scraping and data analysis, focusing on gathering information about Mars from various online sources. Throughout this project, you'll leverage your skills in identifying HTML elements, extracting data, organizing and analyzing it, and visually communicating your findings.

### Overview
This project consists of two key deliverables:

1. Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News Articles
In this task, we scrape titles and preview text from news articles related to Mars. By automating the process of gathering this information from multiple sources, we aim to stay updated with the latest developments and discoveries about the Red Planet.

2. Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
